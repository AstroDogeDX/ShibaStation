  # Server Rules

  This server is currently under HEAVY development and is not *technically* public. If you are here, you should probably know **why** you are here.
  That being said, here is the golden rule during this time:
  ## Don't be a cunt.
  *Rules are and will be subject to change as development progresses, for now, treat this like a LRP-style server, with a bit more freedom at the moment.*
