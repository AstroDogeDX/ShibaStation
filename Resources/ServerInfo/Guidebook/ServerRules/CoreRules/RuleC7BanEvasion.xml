  # Core Rule 7 - Do not attempt to evade bans
  [bold]This is a zero tolerance rule.[/bold]

  Any attempt to evade a ban of any length will result in a permanent, un-appealable ban being applied. This includes, but is not limited to, using alternate accounts, sharing accounts, or using VPNs to connect to the server.

  The correct way to appeal a ban is to contact the staff on the Discord server. Ban appeals are not guaranteed.

  ## Role Ban Evasion
  You should avoid playing as a role you are temporarily banned from. If you are role banned from a role, you should not play as that role during a round. If you are caught playing as a role you are banned from, you will be considered to be evading your role ban.

  Playing as a role you are permanently role banned from will result in a game ban.

  ## Exceptions
  There are no exemptions for evading or attempting to evade game bans. Antagonists who impersonate or take over a role which they are banned from to aid in their goals are not considered to be evading their role ban.
