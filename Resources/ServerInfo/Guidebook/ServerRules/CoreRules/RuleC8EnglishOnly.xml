  # Core Rule 8 - Only use English
  Only English is permitted, both in-character and out-of-character. You must be fluent in English enough to be able to not cause game issues, and to be able to communicate with game admins when necessary. If a game admin does not feel that you are fluent enough in English, they may ban you.

  ## Accent Traits
  Certain accent traits on this server use 'cognate' words, which are words that are similar to their English counterparts.
  
  If you feel as if an Accent Trait isn't understandable enough without knowing the language the accent is based on, please give feedback on the Discord server.

  ## Why
  We do not have enough staff fluent in other languages to moderate them. Translation tools can be unreliable and are not integrated well into the game.

  ## Non-English Options
  There are many servers that allow or focus on other languages. You are highly encouraged to play only on servers that allow languages you are fluent in.
